```

# TL; DR

I made two modifications to my distill website and the corresponding GitHub repository:

1.  Added [giscus](https://giscus.app/) commenting to my blog - this was fairly straightforward and completed within 1 to 2 hours.

2.  Added GitHub actions to automatically update the repository's `README` with blog stats - this took several attempts over the course of a few days.

# Giscus commenting

*Straightforward and completed within 1 to 2 hours.*

Updating the commenting mechanism on my website from discus was something I had been meaning to do for a while, but held off on because you never know when a seemingly small change will take you down a rabbit hole.

I went for it, and thanks to Joel's awesome post [Enable giscus in Distill](https://www.joelnitta.com/posts/2021-11-24_using-giscus/){target="_blank_"} it was a pretty quick and easy process. 🙌

# GitHub Actions README

*Several attempts over the course of a few days.*

After the amazingly quick success of the giscus implementation, I was ready to tackle more! I thought a mini-project on my blog would be a nice entry point to learn GitHub Actions, and I decided to replicate Matt Dray's post [Up-to-date blog stats in your README](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/04/14/gha-readme/){target="_blank_"}. Between intricacies with both the `README` and the GitHub Action workflow `yaml`, this happened:

how is figuring out <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> github actions going, you ask? preeetttty well 👍 <a href="https://t.co/Boj7KvXCAi">pic.twitter.com/Boj7KvXCAi</a>

I mean, sometimes you can skip reading documentation fully, make a few tweaks to your code, cross your fingers, and hope that everything works. GitHub Actions is probably not one of those things. 😬 Below are a few of the errors I suffered through to get this working; hopefully I can save you some of the pain!

### GitHub Actions

-   [`Workflow #1 (error)`](https://github.com/shannonpileggi/pipinghotdata_distill/runs/4391092220?check_suite_focus=true){target="_blank_"} I needed to add `{distill}` as an installed package in my workflow. 🤷

-   [`Workflow #2 (error)`](https://github.com/shannonpileggi/pipinghotdata_distill/runs/4404442737?check_suite_focus=true){target="_blank_"} I was lazy with my README and workflow and loaded `tidvyerse` instead of the specific packages I needed, which didn't go well. I tried to resolve this via the `pak` route (see next error), which also didn't go well, and ended up trimming back the dependencies to the essential ones.

-   [`Workflow #10 (error)`](https://github.com/shannonpileggi/pipinghotdata_distill/runs/4410903654?check_suite_focus=true){target="_blank_"} I tried a few different things to install packages in the workflow with `pak` instead of `install.packages`. I attempted to use [`r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/setup-r-dependencies){target="_blank_"}, and I really should have read the documentation thoroughly. My blog repo is not a package and does not have `DESCRIPTION` file. I tried to add a `DESCRIPTION` file to coerce this, but really, this workflow setup is made for packages. I also attempted to review the source of the workflow and make some tweaks to achieve something similar outside of the package framework, but to no avail. My workflow currently uses `install.packages()`. I could have tried [`r-lib/actions/setup-renv`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/setup-renv){target="_blank_"} instead, but I was tired. There are many errors in my workflow history that correspond to this experimentation.

### README

-   [`Workflow #30 (no error)`](https://github.com/shannonpileggi/pipinghotdata_distill/runs/4499533757?check_suite_focus=true){target="_blank_"} I thought I would get fancy and make the ggplot graphic interactive through `{ggiraph}` with hover over and click effects. This didn't error out, but it also didn't work, which I should have anticipated, as the rendered file is a `.md` and not a `.Rmd`.

-   [`Workflow #26 (no error)`](https://github.com/shannonpileggi/pipinghotdata_distill/actions/runs/1562057755){target="_blank_"} I had many workflows that didn't error out, but also did not result in an updated `README`. I actually had a lot of trouble getting the `README` to work. Some things I learned include:

    -   [`usethis::use_readme_rmd()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_readme_rmd.html){target="*blank*"} is designed for use with R packages, and again, didn't work well on my blog repo.

    -   [`devtools::build_rmd()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_readme_rmd.html){target="*blank*"} is designed for use with R packages, and again, didn't work well on my blog repo.

    -   After I ditched these and my `README` still wasn't rendering correctly, I really, truly thought I was going crazy. I finally found a [solution on RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/t/readme-rmd-in-a-bookdown-repo/93191/7){target="_blank_"} by updating `rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd")` to `rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd", "github_document")` in the `YAML` of the GitHub Action workflow. I wonder if {distill} has some `YAML` stuff going on that required the `"github_document"` argument.



After much perseverance and persistence, I prevailed with my first GitHub Action. 💪 

```{r gha, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#| fig.cap: > 
#|   Updated README file for the [`pipinghotdata_distill`](https://github.com/shannonpileggi/pipinghotdata_distill) 
#|   GitHub repository, with the stats section automatically 
#|   updated daily with GitHub Actions. 
#| fig.alt: > 
#|    The "some stats" section is automatically updated, including a rugline type
#|    graphic with a single vertical line on the date of a each post.

Perhaps reading the documentation more closely or slowing down to think through things might have worked better for this situation. If you want to have a laugh or or want to feel better about your own struggling efforts, browse through my 34 [commits](https://github.com/shannonpileggi/pipinghotdata_distill/commits/master){target="_blank"} or check out the corresponding [GitHub Action history](https://github.com/shannonpileggi/pipinghotdata_distill/actions){target="_blank"} Dec 1 - 12, 2021. Despite the frustration, I remain grateful for these experiences as I learned a lot.

# Afterwards

So what happened after these changes?

### Giscus

One unexpected side effect of using giscus is all of the automatic notifications I receive about the discussion. I get notifications for:

1. on my blog: all comments

2. on blogs by others:

   + replies to my comments
   
   + all comments subsequent to mine, by anyone, as we are now all engaged in the same GitHub discussion.
   
The last one was a bit surprising to me, but I like it for now!


### GitHub Actions

Now that I am using GitHub Actions on the `README` of my repository, I am no longer the only contributor to my repository! 😯  This means
that when I open up my R project, I now need to remember to pull before I start working on my website.

In addition, despite my GitHub Actions working, I ran out of free time as shown in the [`workflow #39 error`](https://github.com/shannonpileggi/pipinghotdata_distill/actions/runs/1572539486){target="_blank"}. 🤦 I guess I either need to figure out `{pak}` out with GitHub Actions to hopefully speed things up, or experiment less to get my actions right.😆
