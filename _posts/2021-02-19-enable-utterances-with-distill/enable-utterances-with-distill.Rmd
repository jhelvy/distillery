# Allow readers to comment on your blog posts

You may be interested, like I was, in allowing reader comments for your {distill} blog posts.

Upon researching the best way, I found that there was some negativity towards some comment platforms, and heard that [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) was a good alternative for now. Thanks go to [Maëlle Salmon](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon) - during her session on [blogging, for R-Ladies Johannesburg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xyc4-bJjdys), she used `utterances` on her [teaching site](https://rmd-blogging-jozi.netlify.app/promotion/further-resources/), and also taught us about it.

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to make my acknowledgements up front, because this post is just a synthesis of two excellent posts from [Maëlle Salmon](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon) and [Miles McBain](https://twitter.com/milesmcbain).

- [Goodbye Disqus! Hello, Utterances](https://masalmon.eu/2019/10/02/disqus/)
- [How I got utteranc.es working on my rmarkdown distill blog](https://milesmcbain.micro.blog/2020/09/04/how-i-got.html)
- This [distill issue](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/155), was also a big help. Thanks to [Taras Kaduk](https://twitter.com/taraskaduk).

Reading their posts will give you the tools you need to have comments on your blog posts using `utterances`. The below is a summary from these resources.

## utterances

"`utterances` is a comments widget built on GitHub issues".

1. To set it up you need to first [install the `utterances` GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/utterances), if you have not already done so.
1. You then need to allow the app access to your __blog repository (repo)__ in GitHub. My blog repo is named `Blog_Vebash` (inspired, eh `r emo::ji("hush")`).

      <img src = utterances1.JPG  width = 800px alt="Give utterances app access to your blog">

1. In GitHub, navigate to the `Issues` tab in your Blog's repo, and open the <span style="color: black;background-color:#FDFD96">`Labels`</span> section as highlighted below.

      <img src = utterances2.JPG  width = 800px alt="Add a label in Issues part I">

1. Choose <span style="color: #fbfffe;background-color:#2ea44f">__New label__</span> to add a label for the *issue* that will serve as your blog's comments. I added mine as:

    <pre>
      <span style="color: black;background-color:#E7CEF2"><b>comments 💬</b></span>
    </pre>

    <img src = utterances3.JPG  width = 800px alt="Add a label in Issues part II">

## HTML File in RStudio Project

We need to add an `.html` file that contains the information for the `utterances` app. Like [Miles](https://milesmcbain.micro.blog/2020/09/04/how-i-got.html) did, I named mine __utterances.html__.

1. Create an `utterances.html` file as shown below, with your blog repo details in the place of the one noted there. Here is [mine](https://github.com/sciencificity/Blog_Vebash/blob/main/utterances.html), copied nearly directly from [Mile's](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/milesmcbain.com/blob/master/utterances.html).

        ```
        <script>
          document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
            if (!/posts/.test(location.pathname)) {
              return;
            }

            var script = document.createElement("script");
            script.src = "https://utteranc.es/client.js";
            script.setAttribute("repo", "sciencificity/Blog_Vebash");
            script.setAttribute("issue-term", "title");
            script.setAttribute("crossorigin", "anonymous");
            script.setAttribute("label", "comments 💬");
            script.setAttribute("theme", "github-light");

            /* wait for article to load, append script to article element */
            var observer = new MutationObserver(function (mutations, observer) {
              var article = document.querySelector("d-article");
              if (article) {
                observer.disconnect();
                /* HACK: article scroll */
                article.setAttribute("style", "overflow-y: hidden");
                article.appendChild(script);
              }
            });

            observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true });
          });
        </script>
        ```

  <aside>
  You may also follow [Taras Kaduk's advice](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/issues/155) and amend the `d-article`, in the `querySelector`, to `d-appendix`, if you want your comments to appear after the appendix, instead of between the article and the appendix.
  </aside>

2. Place __utterances.html__ in your main blog folder.

    <img src = utterances4.JPG  width = 800px alt="Place your utterances.html file in your main blog folder">


3. In your <span style="color: black;background-color:#FDFD96"><b>_site.yml</b></span> file add the `includes` part under your output format YAML. Now comments using `utterances` is available for all your blog posts.

    ```
    output:
      distill::distill_article:
        includes:
          in_header: utterances.html
    ```


## Someone commented `r emo::ji("tada")`

- To comment a reader has to log into their GitHub account, and give the `utterances` app permission.
- When a reader comments it opens a `comment` issue in your Blog's GitHub repo via the `utterances-bot`.
- You may respond on your blog post directly, or in the GitHub repo's `Issues` page.
- If you do it on the `Issues` page, you may also close the issue there.
- As [Maëlle remarks](https://masalmon.eu/2019/10/02/disqus/) the downside is perhaps that your reader needs a GitHub account. I am hopeful this will not be too big of a deterrent for readers. If it is, don't hesitate to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sciencificity) - I am interested to hear your opinion.

#### Happy {distill} Blogging
