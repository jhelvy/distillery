One of the things I love about [{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) as a site builder is that it is super light weight. It comes out of the box with very few bells and whistles, enabling you to create a site from scratch in minutes. I tried using [{blogdown}](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) with the [Hugo Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/), but in the end I found the overall configuration a bit overwhelming, even with the guidance of Alison Hill's incredible [post](https://alison.rbind.io/post/new-year-new-blogdown/) on how to do it (btw, if you want to make a blogdown site, you totally should read her [posts on blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/categories/blogdown/)). Distill was just simpler, so I dove in.

That said, once I did get my distill site running, I found myself longing for some of the really cool features I've seen on peoples' blogdown sites, like [Alison Hill's site](https://alison.rbind.io/) (if you can't tell, Alison's work has been a major source of inspiration for me). But then I realized, "wait a minute...I'm working in R, and whenever I want some functionality that doesn't yet exist, I can just write my own functions!"

So that's what I set out to do - write a bunch of functions and hack away at CSS to construct the features I wanted. This post walks through my general strategy and then shows how I implemented some of the features on my site.

> Full disclosure: I am sure there are probably other (likely better) ways to do some of these things, but this is what I came up with and it worked for me!

# Finding the html

For every feature I wanted to add, my starting point was trying to find an example somewhere of the raw html for that feature. My knowledge of html is very limited and hacky, but I do know that if I see something I want, I can use the "inspect" tool in Chrome to grab the html by right-clicking on it and selecting "Copy element", like this:

<center>
<img src="images/inspect.gif" width=100% class="shadow">
</center>

With some html in hand, I had a template to work with. My starting point was always to just drop the html directly into a page and edit it until it looked the way I wanted. But most of the time I needed to replicate and reuse that html in multiple places, so I had to find a way to write R code to _generate_ html.

# [{htmltools}](https://unleash-shiny.rinterface.com/htmltools-overview.html) to the rescue!

Luckily, some [clever folks](https://unleash-shiny.rinterface.com/references.html#ref-R-htmltools) wrote a package that generates html code! Since html controls formatting by wrapping content inside tags, the {htmltools} package uses a bunch of handy functions to generate those tags for you. For example, if I wanted to make a level 1 header tag, I could use the `h1()` function:

```{r htmltools_div}
library(htmltools)

content <- h1("Hello World")
print(content)
```

For most situations, this works great, but there are also times where I need a tag that isn't yet supported. In those case, you can insert the tags yourself as a string and use the `tag()` function to create custom tags. For example, the `<aside>` tag is used in distill to put content in the sidebar, but {htmltools} does not have an `aside()` function. Instead, I can create those tages like this:

```{r htmltools_raw}
content <- tag("aside", "Hello World")
print(content)
```

With this in mind, we now have just about everything we need to start writing functions to construct some html! I'll start with a simple example of writing a function to insert some text in the sidebar.

# Getting organized

Before I started writing functions, I needed to find a convenient place to put them so I could use them later in my distill articles and posts. Following the typical folder structure for R packages, I decided to make a folder called "R" in the root directory of my distill site and put a file called [`functions.R`](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.github.io/blob/master/R/functions.R) in it. Now I can access any functions I write inside this file by calling the following at the top of any .Rmd file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source(file.path("R", "functions.R"))
```

It's kind of like calling `library(package)` at the top of a file, except your functions don't live in a package. Eventually, I may choose to move some of my functions to an external package so others can use them, but for now they'll live happily in my `functions.R` file `r emo::ji("smile")`.

# Haiku research summaries

Inspired by [Andrew Heiss's research page](https://www.andrewheiss.com/research/), I wanted to insert a haiku summary next to each citation of each paper on my [publications page](https://jhelvy.github.io/publications.html). All you need to do is wrap some text in `<aside>` tags and it will show up in the side bar. But rather than write the html for each haiku (e.g. `<aside>haiku text</aside>`), I decided to write a simple function to generate the html tags for me.

I started with three functions to generate the tags for some center-aligned text in the sidebar:

```{r}
# Generates <aside>text</aside>
aside <- function(text) {
  return(htmltools::tag("aside", list(text)))
}

# Generates <center>text</center>
center <- function(text) {
  return(htmltools::tag("center", list(text)))
}

# Generates <aside><center>text</center></aside>
aside_center <- function(text) {
  return(aside(center(list(text))))
}
```

Now I can insert some center-aligned text in the sidebar with the function `aside_center(text)`. But since haikus have a particular 5-7-5 syllabic structure, I thought it would be better to put each line on a separate row. I also wanted the haikus to be in italic font. So I wrote a `haiku()` function that takes three text inputs and generates the html to put them in the side bar on separate lines:

```{r}
haiku <- function(one, two, three) {
  return(aside_center(list(
    htmltools::em(
      one, htmltools::br(),
      two, htmltools::br(),
      three)
  )))
}
```

With this little function, I can insert haikus throughout my publications page without having to write any html! For example, the html for the haiku for our recent [paper](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aba715) in _Environmental Research Letters_ is generated like this:

```{r}
html <- haiku(
  "A five minute ride",
  "In an EV can increase",
  "The chance you'll buy one"
)

print(html)
```

> **Important caveat**: For this to work, I had to insert each haiku using in-line R code, like this: `` `r knitr::inline_expr('haiku("one", "two", "three")')` ``. If I used a code chunk, the output will get wrapped in a `<div>`, nullifying the `<aside>` tags.

Hopefully this example gives you the gist of the general strategy of writing a function to produce the desired html. For the most part, the strategy is the same for all the other features on this post, with the exception that some require a little CSS sprinkled on top.

# Link "buttons" with icons + text

Everyone knows that cool points are directly proportional to usage of  [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons on your website. So when it came time to add links to content on my [publications page](https://jhelvy.github.io/publications.html), I _had_ to find a way to make it easier to insert icons with the links. Since {htmltools} does not have a default tag for `<i></i>`, I made a function to build the tags using `htmltools::tag()`:

```{r}
# Generates <i class="icon"></i>
make_icon <- function(icon) {
  return(htmltools::tag("i", list(class = icon)))
}
```

I can now get an icon for any fontawesome by using it's class. For example, I can get the GitHub icon like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
make_icon("fab fa-github")
```

Because this function just generates generic `<i></i>` tags, it works with other icon libraries too. For example, I can insert the Google Scholar icon from [academic icons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) using `make_icon("ai ai-google-scholar")`. Cool!

Of course I want links that have icons + text, so I made another function to paste on the text:

```{r}
make_icon_text <- function(icon, text) {
  return(htmltools::HTML(paste0(make_icon(icon), " ", text)))
}
```

And finally, to make a link, I need to make one more function using the `htmltools::a()` function. I also added a class I called `"icon-link"` so I could add some CSS styling later to these links:

```{r}
icon_link <- function(icon = NULL, text = NULL, url = NULL) {
  if (!is.null(icon)) {
    text <- make_icon_text(icon, text)
  }
  return(htmltools::a(href = url, text, class = "icon-link"))
}
```

By itself, this function will produce a link with an icon and text. To make it looks more like a button (which is what I wanted), I added the following CSS in my [`jhelvy.css`](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.github.io/blob/master/css/jhelvy.css) theme, which is the theme I set to all pages in my [`_site.yml`](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.github.io/blob/master/_site.yml) file:

```{css}
.icon-link {
    background-color: var(--color-primary);
    color: var(--color-white);
    padding: 3px 5px 3px 5px;
    margin: 0 2px 0 2px;
    border-radius: 5px; /* Rounded edges */
}

.icon-link:hover {
    background-color: var(--color-secondary);
    color: var(--color-white);
}
```

> Note: I use parameters throughout my css file so I can use common values, like colors, so that's what `var(--color-primary);` and `var(--color-secondary);` are about. You can see what color values these refer to at the top of my [`jhelvy.css`](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.github.io/blob/master/css/jhelvy.css) file.

You can see how these "buttons" look on my [publications page](https://jhelvy.github.io/publications.html). For example, the three buttons at the top are generated with this chunk in my [`publications.Rmd`](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.github.io/blob/master/publications.Rmd) file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
icon_link(
    icon = "ai ai-google-scholar",
    text = "Google Scholar",
    url  = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DY2D56IAAAAJ"
)
icon_link(
    icon = "ai ai-orcid",
    text = "ORCID",
    url  = "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2657-9191"
)
icon_link(
    icon = "ai ai-researchgate",
    text = "Research Gate",
    url  = "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Helveston"
)
```

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE}
icon_link(
    icon = "ai ai-google-scholar",
    text = "Google Scholar",
    url  = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DY2D56IAAAAJ"
)
icon_link(
    icon = "ai ai-orcid",
    text = "ORCID",
    url  = "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2657-9191"
)
icon_link(
    icon = "ai ai-researchgate",
    text = "Research Gate",
    url  = "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Helveston"
)
```
</center>

## Side note on academic icons

The distill package supports [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons out of the box, but if you want to include [academic icons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) you'll need to include a link to the style sheet in the page header. You can quickly add it to all pages by making a `header.html` file in your root directory that contains this line:

```{html}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jpswalsh/academicons@1/css/academicons.min.css">
```

Then in your `_site.yml` you can add it to every page by changing the `output` parameter:

```
output:
  distill::distill_article:
    includes:
      in_header:
      - header.html
```

# Float an image left / right with wrapped text

A very common layout I see on lots of sites is an image floated to the left or right with text wrapping around it. Here's an example from my [lab page](https://jhelvy.github.io/lab.html):

<center>
<img src="images/text_wrap.png" width="600px" class="shadow">
</center>

There are probably lots of ways to do this, but a simple enough solution is to use the `:::` notation to create custom divs. This isn't needed if your output is a `html_document`, but for distill articles you need to create a new div that includes the image _and_ text wrapping around it (see [this issue](https://community.rstudio.com/t/wrapping-text-around-a-right-floated-image-in-rmarkdown-document/94584/2) for details as to why you have to do this).

## Float a single image

If you have just a single image that you want to wrap text around, you can do it like this:

````markdown
:::float-image

`r ''````{r out.width='150px', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("path/to/image")
```

Here is some text you want to wrap around the image.
:::
````

You can name the div whatever you want - I just used `float-image` to be descriptive. I included all the CSS needed to float the image in the code chunk settings: `out.width='150px', out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'`. You may want to adjust the padding to fit your site's look and feel, but this should be all you need to get the job done.

## Float multiple images

Since I use this layout frequently, I decided to define two classes, `float-left` and `float-right`, in my [`jhelvy.css`](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.github.io/blob/master/css/jhelvy.css) theme that style any images in a div with those classes to float left or right, with a little padding:

```{css}
.float-left img {
    float:left;
    padding: 5px 10px 5px 0px;
}

.float-right img {
    float:right;
    padding: 5px 0px 5px 10px;
}
```

Now to float an image and wrap text around it, all I need to do is use one of those classes for the div name, and any images between the `:::` marks will be floated left or right:

````markdown
:::float-left

`r ''````{r, out.width='150px'}
knitr::include_graphics("path/to/image")
```

Here is some text you want to wrap around the image.
:::
````

You can use whatever method you want to insert images, like `knitr::include_graphics()` or just insert direct html (which is what I actually end up doing most often).

> **Caveat**: Anything in the div created by `:::` will be masked to the table of contents, so I don't recomment wrapping a whole article inside `:::` to float multiple images (though you could) and instead recommend wrapping just the elements you want to float.

# "Last updated on..." statement in footer

I wanted to put a date somewhere on my site so people can see when it was last updated, and I figured the footer was a good location since it's out of the way but still on every page (even blog posts). The thing is, {distill} generates the footer from a single, static `_footer.html` file in the root directory. So if I want the date to update in the footer, I have to update the `_footer.html` file on every build.

Not a problem - just make a `create_footer()` function and call it before you build the site! My `create_footer()` function lives in my [`functions.R`](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.github.io/blob/master/R/functions.R) file, and it's a bit long as it also inserts some icons and other text. But the main part doing the date updating is the function `last_updated()`:

```{r}
last_updated <- function() {
  return(htmltools::span(
    paste0(
      'Last updated on ',
      format(Sys.Date(), format="%B %d, %Y")
    ),
    style = "font-size:0.8rem;")
  )
}
```

This just generates a span of the text "Last updated on {date}" with a smaller font size. I call this function inside my `create_footer()` function to grab the latest date, then the function write the `_footer.html` file to the root directory.

To simplify the site build, I put a [build_site.R](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.github.io/blob/master/build_site.R) file in root directory with code to load all the functions in `functions.R`, create the footer, then build the site:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source(file.path("R", "functions.R"))

# Fist build the footer to capture today's date
create_footer()

# Then render the site
rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')
```

Now I just source `build_site.R` and my site builds with an updated footer to today's date! What's even more fun is I use a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/jhelvy/jhelvy.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_site.yml) to automatically run `build_site.R` every time I commit something to the repo where my site lives and commit all the site files to my `gh-pages` branch. So I never have to worry about creating the footer - it's all done automatically!

# Final thoughts

Coming up with little solutions to each of these features was a highly iterative process, and for the most part I really wasn't sure how to do any of this when I first got started. Each feature I added usually started by being inspired from someone else's work, like the haiku research summaries and buttons with icons and text on [Andrew Heiss's research page](https://www.andrewheiss.com/research/). I found the process of coming up with a solution to implement each feature to be a fun way to learn new R tricks, especially in working with CSS. If you're an R / distill / blogdown user looking to customize your site, hopefully these little examples will inspire you too!
