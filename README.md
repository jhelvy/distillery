Welcome to the distillery: a
[distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) website showcasing other
distill websites and blogs!

If you have a distill blog, we would love you have you included in this
list! This is an inclusive community of blogs for everyone to learn
from. Please, add yourself!

## How to add your distill blog / website to the showcase:

**Method 1**: [Open an
issue](https://github.com/jhelvy/distillery/issues) and note your site
`name`, the `url` to your site, and url to the `source` code and we’ll
add it to the showcase!

**Method 2**: If you’re comfortable working with pull requests, follow
these steps:

1.  Fork this repo.
2.  Add your site to the `sites.csv` in the root directory (include a
    `name`, `url` to the site, and url to the `source`).
3.  Open the `distillery.Rproj` file and run `build_site.R`.
4.  Open a pull request to include your changes!

That’s it! Your site will be added to the
[showcase](https://jhelvy.github.io/distillery/showcase.html), complete
with a screen shot and the links to the site and source.
